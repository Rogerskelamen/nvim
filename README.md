> if you want to copy My neovim configuration, this readme tutorial may help you a lot.

> Also, this configuration help me to remember the forgotten function. After all, the configuration is so much.

## Installation

1. Of course you have to install `Neovim`:

  - for Windows:

    ```powershell
    choco install neovim
    ```

  - for Linux:

    ```shell
    apt install neovim
    ```

  - for MacOS:

    ```shell
    brew install neovim
    ```

  > if you don't know what Neovim is, please see [here](https://neovim.io) and [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

2. clone the repo into your `$HOME/.config/`

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Rogerskelamen/nvim.git
  mv -r ./nvim $HOME/.config/
  ```

3. get into your neovim and add plugin: `:PlugInstall`(*optional but recommended*)

## Dependencies

- `python3`

- `node`

- `clang`

- `ctags`

- `figlet`

### Plugin Management

> My neovim use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as default plugin manager

You can change it into other plugin manager as you wish

### Code Completion

> I use the [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) as default code completion tool

#### the extensions in Conquer of Completion

- `coc-yank`

- `coc-vimlsp`

- `coc-syntax`

- `coc-snippets`

- `coc-marketplace`

- `coc-json`

- `coc-html`

- `coc-emmet`

- `coc-vetur`

- `coc-tsserver`

- `coc-jedi`

- `coc-java`

- `coc-go`

- `coc-css`

- `coc-clangd`

- `coc-markmap`

- `coc-tabnine`

- `coc-calc`

You can easily change one of them by adding the following settings:

```vim
let g:coc_global_extensions = ['coc-explorer']
```

## Theme

> My neovim use the [material theme](https://github.com/kaicataldo/material.vim) as default

There has some other options to choose:

- [onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)

- [neodark](https://github.com/KeitaNakamura/neodark.vim)

- [seoul256](https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim)

  A low-contract theme

- [nova](https://github.com/trevordmiller/nova-vim)

  A low-contract theme with cold color (*mainly blue*)

- [cosmic_latte](https://github.com/haystackandroid/cosmic_latte)

  A eye-protected theme (*it changes along with the time, if you don't like the light background, don't turn it on*)

**You may find all the color scheme have their transparent background, but it actually configured by Neovim. You can release the certain line to turn on/off the effect:**

```vim
autocmd vimenter * hi Normal guibg=NONE ctermbg=NONE
```

<u>All of these has coded into the `init.vim`, you can turn on one of them by release the certain comment</u>

### the Cursor

> my neovim makes the cursor as a block when you in normal mode, and it will changes into a slim line once you insert some content

## Basic Usage

> First of all, My LEADER key is <kbd>Space</kbd>, do remember

### Save and Quit

<kbd>S</kbd> for Save, and <kbd>Q</kbd> for Quit

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd> for Quit All!

### the basic movement: J, K, H, L

These four has been changed into move 5 lines or 5 columns

<u>use <kbd>m</kbd> to jump to the end or start of the line</u>

### Windows Open and Move

- `<LEADER>` + movement key

  Move toward the exact direction that you press the key between different windows.

- direction key (<kbd>UP</kbd>...)

  Expand or shrink the windows size according to your direction key

- `<LEADER>` + v or + s

  Create a split window, <kbd>v</kbd> for vertical, <kbd>s</kbd> for no vertical

- `sv`, `sh`

  > split vertically, split horizontally

  Change the format of current split window, `sv` for vertical one, `sh` for horizontal one.

### Quick select and change

> Since I integrated the wildfire and vim-surround, it becomes easy to select a code block and change it into other code blocks(or surrounded by some brackets).

- <kbd>Enter</kbd>+`S"`: select the code block and make it surrounded by `"`

- `cs'"`: change `'` bracket into `"`

### Tab Usage

- `tu`: open a new tab

- `th`, `tl`: move to a left/right tab

### Indentation Usage

> use only one `>` or `<` to indent the line

### Some LEADER key functions

- `<LEADER>rc`: open the `$NVIM/init.vim` with nvim.

- `<LEADER>sc`: open the Spell Check function

- `<LEADER>y`: open the clipboard history

- `<LEADER>o`: toggle fold

### Others

> the default <kbd>s</kbd> key has been disabled. You can either transform it into some other key function

- `<LEADER> + /`: make the highlight disabled

- `\v`: visual mode make to line end

- `\s`: the global replace

- double press `<LEADER>`

  Press space twice to jump to the next '<++>' and edit it, this is a little trick to make your coding more sufficiently

## UI Performance

Line number is shown at left, cursorline is also able. And if you want to turn on the relativenumber, please set `set relativenumber`

I have made the neovim shows the `|` when you press <kbd>Tab</kbd> (*polyglot support*), and the `â–«` when you press <kbd>Space</kbd> as long as the cursor at end of the line.

---

Also, when you open a file, I make the neovim to put your cursor on the position the last place you closed the file.

---

In addition, when you scroll you screen, the cursor will stay 5 lines above the bottom of the screen and 5 lines below the top of the screen.

### Startify

I use `figlet` to draw the 3D-ascii, so you have to get `figlet` installed in your machine if you want the ascii picture.

As well, you have to add [`3d.flf`](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts/blob/master/3d.flf) to `figlet` which makes sure the command works well.

## Run Function

> you can run your code just simply press <kbd>r</kbd> key, and the supported languages are listed below:

- `c`

- `c++`

- `java`

- `shell`

- `python`

- `html`

- `markdown`

- `tex`

- `javascript`

- `go`

*Of course you have to get the correct compiler first*

## Plugin Hot Key

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>: open NerdTree

- `tt`: open the Tagbar

- `<LEADER>c<LEADER>`: comment or discomment one line or a block

- `<LEADER>f`: open the fzf in neovim

- `<LEADER>b`: open the buffers view window

- `<LEADER>r`: open the ranger in neovim

- `<LEADER>m`: open the cmus controller in neovim

- `<LEADER>g`: open the lazygit interface

- `<LEADER>e`: open the chinese translator

- `<LEADER>x`: calculate out the result of current expression

- `<LEADER>u`: toggle the UndoTree

- `LEADER`+<kbd>Enter</kbd>: open a terminal below your edit space

- `[g`: go to the next error place

- `]g`: go to the previous error place

- `gd`: go to the definition

- `gy`: go to the type definition

- `gi`: go to the implementation

- `gr`: go to the references

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd>: show document

- `<LEADER>H`: preview the Git Change

- `<LEADER>gf`: fold git Gutter

- `g-`: go to previous git change

- `g=`: go to next git change

*The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> has been mapped as nerdtree, so I map the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> to return the next changed area*

## Markdown Usage

> For a better experience of markdown writing, you should add a file named `.ctags` in your `$HOME` directory. It contains following content:

```
--langdef=markdown
--langmap=markdown:.md
--regex-markdown=/^(#+)[ \t]+([^#]*)/\1 \2/h,header,Markdown Headers/
--regex-markdown=/\[([^\[]+)\]\(([^\)]+)\)/\1/l,link,Markdown Links/
--regex-markdown=/!\[\]\(.*[\/ ](.*\.[a-z]{3})\)/\1/i,image,Markdown Image/
```

Then you could press <kbd>tt</kbd> to call your ctags to show markdown outline.

*Make sure that you have installed `ctags`*

- `,b`: bold text

- `,i`: italic text

- `,u`: underline text

- `,k`: keyboard text

- `,$`: latex math text

- `st`: toggle markdown table mode

- `<LEADER>z`: open the markmap in browser
